Official repository and project is on [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~bacardi55/cleanABag). Github and codeberg are only mirrors. This is where binaries are uploaded.


cleanABag is a CLI tool for removing articles older than a given date from wallabag.

The goal is to avoid wasted storage of 100s or 1000s of articles that aren't needed in wallabag anymore.

To install, either download a binary from the [release page](https://git.sr.ht/~bacardi55/cleanABag/refs) or via the result of an [automated build](https://builds.sr.ht/?search=cleanABag).

Or manually (you need go >= 1.17 and make):

```bash
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~bacardi55/cleanABag
cd cleanABag
make dependencies
make build
```

The binary will be in the `bin` directory.
